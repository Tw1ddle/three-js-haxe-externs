# three.js r73 haxe externs

Automatically generated from the typescript definitions https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/threejs

The typescript->haxe generator itself is not quite ready for release but it's able to generate complete externs for three.js without any additional input. This means that we'll be able to easily keep the three.js externs up to date with the DefinitelyTyped definitions
